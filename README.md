# IPL Analysis Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of IPL (Indian Premier League) data using Tableau. The dashboard consists of 13 sheets visualizing key performance indicators such as team and player statistics, match trends, and insights over multiple IPL seasons. The goal is to help stakeholders understand team performance, player efficiency, and match dynamics.

## Features
- **Team Performance Analysis**: Visual comparison of team performance over different seasons.
- **Player Insights**: Identification of top-performing batsmen and bowlers.
- **Match Statistics**: Win/loss patterns based on toss and trend analysis across seasons.
- **Toss Decision Analysis**: Analysis of how toss decisions impact match outcomes.
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can filter data based on seasons, teams, and players.
- **Visualizations**: Charts, graphs, and maps to enhance the storytelling aspect.
